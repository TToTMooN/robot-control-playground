<!--
Placeholder URDF for the Franka Research 3 (FR3) robot.

This file is intentionally minimal and does not describe a real robot.  To
use the FR3 model in simulation or with Pinocchio, replace this file with
the official URDF distributed by Franka Emika or your robotic middleware.

The URDF below defines a single fixed link so that the parser does not
fail when loading the file.  It should be replaced with a complete
description including all links, joints and inertial properties.
